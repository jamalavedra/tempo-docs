# Fee AMM Overview

The Fee AMM (Automated Market Maker) is a dedicated system for converting transaction fees between different stablecoins. It enables users to pay fees in any supported stablecoin while allowing validators to receive fees in their preferred token.

## How It Works

When a user pays fees in a stablecoin that differs from the validator's preference, the Fee AMM automatically converts the payment:

- **User pays**: 1.0 of their chosen stablecoin
- **Validator receives**: 0.9970 of their preferred stablecoin
- **Liquidity providers earn**: 0.003 (0.3%) as fees

This conversion happens automatically at the end of each block through batched swaps, preventing MEV attacks like sandwiching.
